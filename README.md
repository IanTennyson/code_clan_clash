# code_clan_clash
My final project for CodeClan. A typing speed test, written in JavaScript using Rails and React.

To run CodeClanClash:

cd code_clan_clash_react
npm install
npm start

Open a new Terminal tab
cd client
npm install
npm start

Open a new Terminal tab
cd out of code_clan_clash_react and into code_clan_clash_rail
Inside the Rails folder run the command: 
rails s -p 5000

For the best experience use Google Chrome and ensure your browser window is full screen.
Due to time constraints the CSS for this project isn't responsive. Sorry!

In Chrome use the address:
http://localhost:3000/

Enjoy!
